# Recursion-top
A couple of projects to practise recursion as part of The Odin Project. I've already done these in Python, so I'm keen to see how my implementation differs in Ruby.

## [Fibonacci](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fibonacci_number)
The fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical sequence. It might be more known through its rules and helpng approxiamte the [Golden spiral](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Golden_spiral). Since this was simple I have a few tasks I can do:
- [x] (Optional) Make it colourful!
- [] (Optional) Format the numbers so they read more nicely

## [Merge Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/)
A well-known sorting algorithm using a diver-and-conquer approach that lends itself well to a recursive implementation. Like above, here are some tasks I can do to make it (look) interesting:
- [] (Optional) Make it colourful! (The usual huh)
- [] (Optional) Display a small visualisation of the swapping process
