# Recursion-top
A couple of projects to practise recursion as part of The Odin Project. I've already done these in Python, so I'm keen to see how my implementation differs in Ruby. I decided to do some optional tasks (set by myself) to make it more interesting. Live version on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@qamk/recursion-top#README.md).

## [Fibonacci](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fibonacci_number)
The fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical sequence. It might be more known through its rules and helpng approxiamte the [Golden spiral](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Golden_spiral). Here are some tasks I set to make it (look) interesting:
- [x] (Optional) Make it colourful!
- [x] (Optional) Allow users to choose their nth term
- [] (Optional) Format the numbers so they read more nicely

## [Merge Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/)
A well-known sorting algorithm using a diver-and-conquer approach that lends itself well to a recursive implementation. Like above, here are some tasks I can do to make it (look) interesting:
- [x] (Optional) Make it colourful! (The usual huh)
- [x] (Optional) Display a small visualisation of the swapping process
- [x] (Optional) Allow users to select their max range and array length
